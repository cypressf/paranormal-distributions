We discuss Ergot, a grain fungus that caused gangrene, convulsions, and perhaps mass hysteria at various points in the middle ages.

Ergot symptoms have been theorized to potentially the cause of some spiritual or religious phenomena. People may have believed that the victims of ergotism were possessed, and ergotism could have given others hallucinations that led them to believe they were witnessing witchcraft.
